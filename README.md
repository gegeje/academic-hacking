# trojan-project-kabdit-il-hilali
i am developing a new trojan i have made some features and the other will be completed
i am trying to develop a trojan horse with new features my first feature consists of a client and server
the server runs on the victim computer without any signs ... but it will opwn a sepecific port on the victim computer
this port will allow the hacker with its client to enter the ip of the victim on a textbox the cd of the victim will open and close in
a made manner and a horrible ambulance sound will rum on his computer....
this will be the first stwp to develop my trojan with new features like peer to peer programming and dll injection methodology...enjoy
